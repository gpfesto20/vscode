 partition-based clustering in unsupervised learning, focusing on K-Means clustering. This approach divides data into distinct clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and their cluster centers (in K-Means) or representative points (in K-Medoids).

K-Means Clustering Summary:
K-Means is an iterative algorithm that groups data into k clusters by assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.
Steps include:
Select a value for k.
Choose k initial points as centroids.
Compute distances and assign data points to the nearest centroid.
Recalculate centroids based on current assignments.
Repeat until convergence (no further changes in cluster assignments)
